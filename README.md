Sidenote: I made a [very detailed yet completely unedited process doc](./wiki/process_beginners.md) for absolute beginners to follow what I did command-by-command including all of my CLI output. You can refer to this if you have more questions about my setup process. It's messy, but I thought it could possibly help out. You can see how many times I messed up and what I had to do to fix things.
