# Dojo Project - Learning the Build Process for a React Web App

# Summary

### Use cases
 - Build a React app with one page and host on GitHub Pages (I built without a custom domain). Here's [the live app](https://hashbangash.github.io/dojo/).
 - Know the build process with yarn & Parcel and use to build other sites easily with other JS libraries like Bootstrap and tools like Sass like I did for [my portfolio](https://hashbangash.github.io/dev/).

### Limitations
 - Small bugs with react-router-dom `BrowserRouter` and GitHub Pages routing make it possibly unusable for a professional app, but if you use a custom domain with GitHub Pages, it could possibly work. This is explained more in [9. react-router-dom experiment](./wiki/router.md).

## Extra troubleshooting
I made a [very detailed yet completely unedited process doc](./wiki/process_beginners.md) for absolute beginners to follow what I did command-by-command including all of my CLI output. You can refer to this if you have more questions about my setup process. It's messy, but I thought it could possibly help out. You can see how many times I messed up and what I had to do to fix things.
