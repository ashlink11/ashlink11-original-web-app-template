# Project Goals

I want to learn way more about DevOps and infrastructure as a developer. This is the first time creating my own build process from scratch. Using: `yarn`, `parcel`, `react`, `gh-pages`, and `docker`. It's really cool to learn the toolchain that leads up to containerization, container orchestration, configuration management, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), etc., etc.

I will use this project in order to build [my portfolio](https://github.com/hashbangash/dev) toolchain from scratch and create Version 4 of my portfolio.

I also want to practice my technical writing.
