# Project Goals

I want to learn more about DevOps and infrastructure as a software developer.

This was the first time creating my own build process from scratch.

It's really cool to learn the toolchain that leads up to containerization, container orchestration, configuration management, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), etc.

I used this project in order to build [my portfolio](https://github.com/hashbangash/dev) toolchain from scratch.

I also wanted to practice my technical writing.
