# Reflection 1 (Friday May 1, 2020)

I realize that there are many layers to learning Docker, and I was happy to learn the basics of it.

Failures:
- I wasn't able to Dockerize my dojo app.

Successes:
- I was able to Dockerize a React app and spin up a node server to host it locally.
- I was able to build a React app from scratch with `yarn`, `parcel` and deploy to production with `gh-pages`.
- I documented the process so others could follow after me.
- I will be able to use this build to host my portfolio app!
- I will be able to use this build to test out the react-router-dom library!

### Next steps

I am going to build out page content and want to add `react-router-dom` so this site can have multiple pages.
