# Reflection 1 (Friday May 1, 2020)

I realize that there are many layers to learning Docker, and I was happy to learn the basics of it.

Failures:
- I wasn't able to Dockerize my dojo app.

Successes:
- I was able to Dockerize a React app and spin up a node server to host it *locally*.
- I was able to build a React app from scratch with `yarn`, `parcel` and deploy to production with `gh-pages`.
- I documented the process so others could follow after me.
- I will be able to use this build to host my portfolio app!
- I will be able to use this build to test out the react-router-dom library!

### Next steps

I am going to build out page content and want to add `react-router-dom` so this site can have multiple pages.

# Reflection 2 (Monday, May 18, 2020)

I did experiment with the `react-router-dom` and added the corresponding page in this little wiki. Main takeaways are that I want to use a different hosting service other than GitHub Pages to make it fully work and truly to understand routing and sitemaps. My attempt is stored on [this branch](https://github.com/hashbangash/dojo/tree/react-router-dom-attempt).

I also built out the app on <https://hashbangash.github.io/dojo/> so there's more information and so that it can be a truly useful and complete tutorial for others that expresses its limitations and use-cases.

# Reflection 3 (Wednesday, June 10, 2020)

I was able to go through the build process with a friend and again by myself.

## Extra troubleshooting
I made a [very detailed yet completely unedited process doc](./process_beginners.md) for absolute beginners to follow what I did command-by-command including all of my CLI output. You can refer to this if you have more questions about my setup process. It's messy, but I thought it could possibly help out. You can see how many times I messed up and what I had to do to fix things.
